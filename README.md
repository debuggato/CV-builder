# CV builder

📝 The idea is to create Resumes with export in .pdf and .doc. A project written in React.js and Typescript

## The idea behind

For months I was searching for a free tool which allows me to create, in an awesome way, my own resume without paying for it, but I failed.
I believe that this kind of tool should be free so I decided to start this project as a way to improve my own skills on React.js and the hope to have the necessary help from the open source community to create a great experience through the creation of our resumes.

## Contributing

We can build something awesome!
Please, if you are interested in this project, feel free to contact me at [ivan.lori@protonmail.com](mailto:ivan.lori@protonmail.com).  
There're lots of things to do, (this project is born recently).
Major features are:

- backend written in python;

For minor features I'll create open Issue on Github.
